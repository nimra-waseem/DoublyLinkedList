A doubly linked list is a type of data structure where each element (or node) contains links to both its previous and next elements, allowing traversal in both directionsâ€”forward and backward.

Structure of a Doubly Linked List Node:
Each node consists of:

Data: The value stored in the node.
Next Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list.
Previous Pointer: A reference to the previous node in the list.
